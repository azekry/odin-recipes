        <h2>My history with the Vegan Palak Paneer</h2>
        <p>When my mother was fresh out of university, she took her nursing degree
            and flew to straight to India. She spent around six years there, 
            volunteering for the Salvation Army as a nurse for the less fortunate people 
            that did not have access to proper healthcare. During her time there, she 
            learned a lot about cooking Indian cuisine, and that knowledge has followed 
            her around to this day. When I found this recipe it reminded me of my mother's 
            cooking so I just knew I had to try it. It has since become a favorite in my 
            household.
