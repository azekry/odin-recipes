        <p>Just like most people in this world, I LOVE PIZZA. Sometimes I feel like I could eat it everyday of the week for every single meal. This is currently my favorite recipe to make homemade dough, and I usually make it about three times a month. Pizza is typically a weekend food in my household and that is because it can be fun to make. This recipe yields one big dough ball which is enough for approximately three large pizzas. You will not regret using this recipe.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>5 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl add the warm water and sugar, sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and then stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil, flour and salt, then with a fork mix it until the dough starts to come together. On a lightly floured surface remove the dough from the bowl and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Will take approximately 7-10 minutes. Feel free to add extra flour if the dough is sticky.</li>
            <li>Place in a lightly oiled bowl and roll the dough so it is covered lightly with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Leave in a warm draft free area until the dough has roughly doubled in size. Will take approximately 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degress fahrenheit (250 celsius). Punch down the dough a few times and then divide it into 3 balls. Let the dough rest for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in the desired pizza or baking sheet (lightly oiled) and shape the dough into the desired shape for your pizza.</li>
            <li>Top with your favorite toppings and bake for roughly 15-20 minutes (until crust is golden). If you are unsure then check the bottom of the dough to make sure it is golden as well. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
            <li>If you have leftover dough, feel free to store in an airtight container or in a plastic bag. Remove any air and the dough will stay well in the fridge for up to three days.</li>
