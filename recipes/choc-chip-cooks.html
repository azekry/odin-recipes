        <h2>The best vegan chocolate chip cookies</h2>
        <p>Last year, while at work, I was gifted a vegan cookbook from a coworker. I am always interested in taking a peek at these cookbooks, but for the most part I never actually use them. I decided to change that on this day and I attempted to make this chocolate chip cookie recipe which very quickly made it to the top of my favorite cookie list. Anytime I even think about baking any sweets, this recipe is always near the top. The cookies are soft, delicious, and completely vegan! Yay!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking sode</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut oil (melted and cooled) or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons of room temperature water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted peanut or almond butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk sugar, melted oil, water, almond/peanut butter, and vanilla in large bowl until well combined and smooth. Using rubber spatula, stir flour mixture into oil mixture until just combined; fold in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours; let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before portioning.)</li>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons, then arrange dough mounds 2 inches apart on prepared sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until light golden and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 12-14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Let cookies cool completely on sheet. Serve. (Cookies can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)</li>
